### 4. [Air-Flick](https://github.com/macromrit/Air-Flick) – *Data Transmission Paradigm ✊🏻*
Air Flick is a system that allows users to transfer images between two devices using simple hand gestures. With a swipe of your hand, files are lifted into the "air", and with another gesture, they are delivered to a nearby device — completely touchless.

### 5. [Centrium](https://github.com/macromrit/Centrium) – *End-to-End Secure File Gateway 🔐*
Centrium is a secure file encryption platform that combines AES-256 encryption with Merkle Tree-based integrity verification. When a file is uploaded, it is split into chunks, each encrypted individually, and then hashed to construct a Merkle Tree. The resulting root hash acts as a unique fingerprint of the file's encrypted state. During decryption, the system verifies this root to detect any tampering — even a single byte change is flagged. This ensures both data confidentiality and tamper-proof integrity, making Merkrypt ideal for secure transmission, backups, and forensic-sensitive data storage.

### 6. [Promptopia](https://github.com/macromrit/Promptopia) – *Prompt Sharing Hub 📪*
A lightweight Next.js application to create, store, and share prompts for large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the idea of a centralized prompt library, PromptHub helps developers and researchers manage their growing list of prompts in one place.

### 9. [Multi-Agentic Auto-tool Picker & Executor](https://github.com/macromrit/tool-selector) – *Multi Agent Automation 🤖*
A structured, modular math problem solver built using BAML and langgraph. This system takes a natural language math query and breaks it down into smaller solvable steps, choosing the appropriate tool (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide), executing the operations in sequence, and returning the final result. If the system encounters an unsupported instruction, it gracefully falls back to a MISSING tool.

### 10. [Weather MCP Server](https://github.com/macromrit/tool-selector) – *Tool Executor and Context Provider 📰*
This is a minimal FastMCP server that serves as a weather alert provider. It allows MCP clients and LLM agents to query real-time weather alerts for U.S. states using the National Weather Service API.
